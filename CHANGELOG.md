## [1.5.3] - 2025-07-17

### üîß Major Fix: GDPR/Vulnerability Scan Separation

#### üö® Problem Resolved

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- **Enhanced Method**: `scanWorkspaceWithStandards()` now accepts optional `enableSecurityScan` parameter
- **Updated Commands**: All 9 individual compliance commands now disable security scanning (`enableSecurityScan: false`)
- **Preserved Functionality**: Main workspace scan still does combined compliance + security scanning
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear debug output shows when security scanning is enabled/disabled

#### ‚úÖ Commands Now Compliance-Only
- **GDPR**: Pure GDPR compliance scanning (no vulnerability noise)
- **HIPAA**: Pure HIPAA compliance scanning  
- **PCI-DSS**: Pure PCI-DSS compliance scanning
- **ISO-27001**: Pure ISO-27001 compliance scanning
- **FedRAMP**: Pure FedRAMP compliance scanning (individual command)
- **DPDP**: Pure DPDP compliance scanning
- **ISO-27002**: Pure ISO-27002 compliance scanning
- **SOC-2**: Pure SOC-2 compliance scanning
- **NIST-CSF**: Pure NIST-CSF compliance scanning

#### üéØ Benefits
- Clean, focused compliance reports without security vulnerability contamination
- Faster compliance-only scans (no vulnerability scanning overhead)
- Better regulatory reporting accuracy
- Enhanced debug capabilities for troubleshooting

## [1.5.1] - 2025-07-17

### üö® Critical Bug Fix - Individual Compliance Scan Commands

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Zero Issues Problem

- **Solution**: Added `scanWorkspaceWithStandards()` method and updated all individual scan commands

#### üîß Technical Implementation
- **New Method**: Added `ComplianceScanner.scanWorkspaceWithStandards(standards[], level?)`
