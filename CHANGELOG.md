## [1.4.2-hotfix] - 2025-07-17

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix - GDPR Report Hanging Issue

#### 🛠️ Emergency Hotfix
- **Fixed GDPR Report Hanging**: Resolved critical issue where GDPR compliance reports would hang at "Running scan for GDPR" message
- **Added storeReport() Method**: Implemented non-blocking report storage to prevent webview panel blocking
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling and user feedback for individual compliance commands
- **Applied Pattern Fix**: Updated GDPR and HIPAA commands to use new non-blocking storeReport() pattern

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **ReportGenerator Enhancement**: Added public `storeReport(report: ComplianceReport): void` method
- **Command Pattern Update**: Individual compliance commands now use storeReport() instead of generateComplianceOnlyReport()
- **Webview Prevention**: Prevents hanging caused by webview panel creation during individual report generation
- **Auto-Scan Preservation**: Maintains automatic scanning functionality while fixing blocking issues

#### 🎯 Issue Resolution
- **Root Cause**: generateComplianceOnlyReport() was opening webview panels causing UI blocking
- **Solution**: Direct report storage without webview panel creation for individual commands
- **Impact**: GDPR, HIPAA, and all individual compliance reports now complete without hanging
- **Testing**: Verified fix with comprehensive test suite and package validation
