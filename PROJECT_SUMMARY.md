  - Vulnerable components (CWE-1104)
  - Insufficient logging (CWE-778)
  - Broken access control (CWE-284)

- ✅ **7 Security Checks**: Context-aware vulnerability detection
  - Hardcoded credentials detection
  - Weak cryptographic algorithms
  - Injection vulnerability patterns
  - Broken access control (wildcards, overly permissive)
  - Security misconfigurations
  - Sensitive data exposure risks
  - Outdated component versions

### 3. FedRAMP Compliance Controls
- ✅ **6 Control Families**: Complete implementation
  - **AC (Access Control)**: 8 controls with 24 implementation checks
  - **AU (Audit and Accountability)**: 3 controls with 9 implementation checks
  - **CM (Configuration Management)**: 4 controls with 12 implementation checks
  - **IA (Identification and Authentication)**: 3 controls with 9 implementation checks
  - **SC (System and Communications Protection)**: 6 controls with 18 implementation checks
  - **SI (System and Information Integrity)**: 3 controls with 9 implementation checks

- ✅ **Impact Levels**: Low, Moderate, High compliance levels supported
- ✅ **81 Total Compliance Checks**: Comprehensive coverage of FedRAMP requirements

### 4. AI-Enhanced Reporting System
- ✅ **Copilot Integration**: AI-generated reports with executive summaries
- ✅ **Combined Security & Compliance Reporting**: Unified analysis and recommendations
- ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Prioritized findings with risk scoring
- ✅ **Remediation Plans**: Step-by-step guidance for fixing issues
- ✅ **Multiple Export Formats**: JSON and Markdown report export
- ✅ **Webview Interface**: Interactive report viewing within VS Code

### 5. Developer Experience
- ✅ **Tree View Provider**: Visual representation of scan results
- ✅ **Diagnostics Integration**: Issues appear in VS Code Problems panel
- ✅ **Command Palette**: Easy access to all scanning functions
- ✅ **Context Menus**: Right-click scanning for specific files
- ✅ **Configuration Settings**: Customizable scan patterns and compliance levels

## 🎯 Available Commands
1. **FedRAMP: Scan Workspace** - Complete compliance and security scan
2. **FedRAMP: Scan Current File** - Single file analysis
3. **FedRAMP: Scan Security Only** - Security vulnerability scanning only
4. **FedRAMP: Generate Report** - AI-enhanced comprehensive reporting
5. **FedRAMP: Set Compliance Level** - Configure Low/Moderate/High impact levels

## 📊 Testing Results
- ✅ **Compilation**: No errors, clean build
- ✅ **Package Creation**: Successfully created .vsix file
- ✅ **Sample Detection**: Test files correctly identify both compliance and security issues
- ✅ **Error Integration**: Issues properly displayed in VS Code Problems panel
- ✅ **Report Generation**: AI-enhanced reports working correctly

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights

### Security Scanner Integration
```typescript
// Combined scanning approach
const securityResults = await this.securityScanner.scanFile(filePath, content);
const complianceResults = this.scanFileContent(content, filePath, level);

// Unified result structure
interface CombinedScanResult {
    complianceIssues: ComplianceIssue[];
    securityVulnerabilities: SecurityVulnerability[];
}
```

### Vulnerability Detection Engine
- Context-aware pattern matching
- OWASP Top 10 methodology
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) mapping
- File-type specific security checks
- Risk severity scoring

### Enhanced Reporting
- Security vulnerability summaries
- Combined risk assessments
- Integrated remediation guidance
- Executive-level security overviews
