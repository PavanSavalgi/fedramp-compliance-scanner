## âœ… Successfully Compiled & Packaged

### **Package Details:**
- **File:** `fedramp-compliance-scanner-1.5.3.vsix`
- **Size:** 192.25 KB (106 files)
- **Compilation:** âœ… Successful (no errors)
- **Package Status:** âœ… Ready for distribution

### **Major Fix Included:**
ðŸ”§ **GDPR/Vulnerability Scan Separation** - Resolved the issue where individual compliance scans were contaminated with security vulnerability results.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**
- Running "Scan for GDPR Compliance" would also run security vulnerability scans
- Compliance reports were mixed with security findings
- Impossible to get clean, focused compliance-only reports

### **Solution:**
- Enhanced `scanWorkspaceWithStandards()` method with `enableSecurityScan` parameter
- Updated all 9 individual compliance commands to disable security scanning
- Preserved combined scanning for main workspace scan command
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### **Result:**
âœ… **Clean Compliance Scanning:** Individual compliance scans now provide pure compliance results  
âœ… **Maintained Flexibility:** Combined scanning still available when needed  
âœ… **Better Performance:** Compliance-only scans are faster (no vulnerability overhead)  
âœ… **Enhanced Debugging:** Clear logging shows exactly what type of scan is running

- "Scan for GDPR Compliance"
