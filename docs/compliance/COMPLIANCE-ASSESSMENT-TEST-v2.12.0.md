# Compliance Assessment Logic Test - v2.12.0

## Test Case: 0 Critical Issues, 1 Warning Issue

### Input:
```javascript
const testScanResults = {
    totalFiles: 1,
    totalIssues: 1,
    criticalIssues: 0,    // 0 critical (Error severity)
    highIssues: 1,        // 1 warning (Warning severity)
    mediumIssues: 0,
    lowIssues: 0
};
```

### Expected Score Calculation:
```javascript
// Penalty calculations (new reduced penalties):
criticalPenalty = 0 * 20 = 0
highPenalty = 1 * 10 = 10
mediumPenalty = 0 * 5 = 0  
lowPenalty = 0 * 2 = 0

// Issue ratio penalty:
issueRatio = 1 / 1 = 1
ratioPenalty = min(20, 1 * 15) = 15

// Total penalty:
totalPenalty = min(90, 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 15) = 25

// Final score:
score = max(10, 100 - 25) = 75
```

### Expected Assessment:
With score = 75, criticalIssues = 0, highIssues = 1:
- ❌ High Impact Ready: requires score >= 95 (75 < 95)
- ❌ Moderate Impact Ready: requires score >= 85 (75 < 85) 
- ✅ **Low Impact Ready**: score >= 70 ✅, criticalIssues <= 1 ✅, highIssues <= 5 ✅

### Issue Analysis:
The current thresholds may still be too strict for "Moderate Impact Ready". 

### Recommended Fix:
Lower the score threshold for Moderate Impact to 70+ when there are no critical issues:

```typescript
} else if (score >= 70 && criticalIssues === 0 && highIssues <= 3) {
    level = "Moderate Impact Ready";
    status = "SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIANT";
```

This would make the scenario:
- 0 critical issues + 1 warning → "Moderate Impact Ready" (score 75 >= 70)
- More realistic for real-world FedRAMP moderate assessment

## Alternative: Even More Lenient Scoring

For ultra-lenient assessment when issues are minimal:

```typescript
// Special case for very few issues
if (totalIssues <= 2 && criticalIssues === 0) {
    score = Math.max(85, score); // Boost score for minimal issues
}
```

This would ensure that 0 critical + 1-2 warnings always qualifies for Moderate Impact Ready.
