# 🎯 FIX: "No workspace folder found" Error

## Issue Identified ✅
The GDPR scan is failing because the Extension Development Host doesn't have a workspace folder open.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. In the Extension Development Host Window:
1. **File** → **Open Folder...**
2. **Navigate to**: `/Users/pavan.savalgi/src/Fedramp Compliance`
3. **Click "Open"**

### 2. Verify Workspace is Open:
- Check that you see the project files in the Explorer panel
- Verify `test-gdpr-scan.md` is visible in the file tree

### 3. Run GDPR Scan Again:
1. **Open Command Palette**: `Cmd+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: "Scan for GDPR Compliance" 
3. **Run the command**

### 4. Expected Result:
With the workspace now open, you should see:
```
🔍 GDPR SCAN DEBUG: Starting scan...
📁 GDPR SCAN DEBUG: Found workspace folder: /Users/pavan.savalgi/src/Fedramp Compliance
📋 GDPR SCAN DEBUG: Standards to scan: GDPR
...
🎯 FOUND 10 GDPR VIOLATIONS! ✅
```

## Why This Happened:
- VS Code Extension Development Host launched without a workspace
- The scanner requires a workspace folder to scan files
- Our DEBUG caught this perfectly at the exact failure point!

## Alternative Solution:
If you prefer, you can also:
1. Close the Extension Development Host
2. In the main VS Code window, press `F5` again
3. This time it should open the workspace automatically

---

**Once you open the workspace folder, the GDPR scan should detect all 10 violations!**
