# 🧪 Testing the GDPR Scan Command in VS Code

## Current Status
- ✅ Extension compiles successfully
- ✅ GDPR patterns verified working (9 violations detected in direct test)
- ✅ Comprehensive DEBUG logging added to GDPR scan command
- ✅ Extension Development Host launched

## Test Steps

### 1. Wait for Extension to Load
Make sure VS Code Extension Development Host is fully loaded and the extension is activated.

### 2. Open Developer Console
- In the Extension Development Host window: `Help > Toggle Developer Tools`
- Click on the `Console` tab

### 3. Run GDPR Scan Command
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to open Command Palette
- Type "GDPR" or "Scan for GDPR Compliance"
- Select the command

### 4. Watch Console Output
Look for these DEBUG messages:
```
🎯 DEBUG: GDPR scan command started
📊 DEBUG: VS Code workspace folders: 1
📞 DEBUG: Calling scanWorkspaceWithStandards with ["GDPR"]
🌐 DEBUG: scanWorkspaceWithStandards called with standards: ["GDPR"]
📁 DEBUG: Found workspace folders: 1
🎯 DEBUG: *** test-compliance.md found in file list ***
📊 DEBUG: Scan completed
📈 DEBUG: Total issues: X
```

### 5. Expected Results
- **If working correctly**: Should find 9 GDPR violations (same as direct test)
- **If broken**: Will show 0 issues, but DEBUG messages will reveal where pipeline breaks

## Key Files for Testing
- **test-compliance.md**: Contains 9 GDPR violations
- **Scanner with DEBUG**: Full pipeline logging
- **Extension command**: Enhanced with detailed debugging

The comprehensive DEBUG logging will show exactly where the GDPR scanning pipeline fails in VS Code!
