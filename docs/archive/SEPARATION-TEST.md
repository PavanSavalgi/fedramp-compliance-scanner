# Test GDPR vs Vulnerability Separation

This file tests that GDPR compliance scanning and vulnerability scanning are properly separated.

## Test Script

Here's how to verify the separation:

### 1. Run GDPR Scan Only
- Command: "Scan for GDPR Compliance"
- Expected: Should see `🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled: false` in console
- Expected: Should see `⏭️ DEBUG: Skipping security scan` messages for each file
- Expected: Should only find GDPR compliance issues, no vulnerability issues

### 2. Run Full Workspace Scan  
- Command: "Scan Workspace for FedRAMP Compliance & Security"
- Expected: Should see `🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled: true` in console  
- Expected: Should see `🔐 DEBUG: Running security scan` messages for each file
- Expected: Should find both compliance issues AND vulnerability issues

### 3. Expected Debug Output for GDPR-Only Scan:
```
🔍 DEBUG: scanWorkspaceWithStandards called
📋 DEBUG: Standards requested: ["GDPR"] 
🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled: false
🔐 DEBUG: Final security scan setting: false
Starting compliance scan for standards: GDPR (compliance only)...
📄 DEBUG: scanFilesBatchWithStandards called with X files
🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled for batch: false
⏭️ DEBUG: Skipping security scan for file.ext (disabled for compliance-only scan)
```

### 4. What This Fixes:
- ✅ **Before**: GDPR scan was running security scans too, mixing results
- ✅ **After**: GDPR scan only does compliance checking, no vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Before**: All individual compliance scans included vulnerability scanning  
- ✅ **After**: Individual compliance scans are pure compliance checks only
- ✅ **Preserved**: Full workspace scan still does both compliance + security

### 5. Commands That Now Do Compliance-Only (No Vulnerability Scanning):
- "Scan for GDPR Compliance"
- "Scan for HIPAA Compliance" 
- "Scan for PCI-DSS Compliance"
- "Scan for ISO-27001 Compliance"
- "Scan for FedRAMP Compliance" (individual)
- "Scan for DPDP Compliance"
- "Scan for ISO-27002 Compliance" 
- "Scan for SOC-2 Compliance"
- "Scan for NIST-CSF Compliance"

### 6. Commands That Still Do Both:
- "Scan Workspace for FedRAMP Compliance & Security" (main combined scan)
- "Security Vulnerability Scan Only" (security-only scan)

This separation ensures clean compliance reporting without vulnerability noise!
