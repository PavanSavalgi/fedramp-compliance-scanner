# 🚀 Release Notes - Version 1.5.3

**Release Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Package:** `fedramp-compliance-scanner-1.5.3.vsix`  
**Size:** 192.25 KB (106 files)

## 🔧 Major Fix: GDPR/Vulnerability Scan Separation

### **Problem Resolved:**
❌ **Before v1.5.3:** When running individual compliance scans (like "Scan for GDPR Compliance"), the system would also run security vulnerability scans, mixing compliance issues with security findings and contaminating compliance reports.

✅ **After v1.5.3:** Individual compliance scans are now pure compliance-only, providing clean, focused reports without security vulnerability noise.

### **Technical Changes:**

1. **Enhanced `scanWorkspaceWithStandards` Method:**
   - Added optional `enableSecurityScan` parameter
   - Allows explicit control over vulnerability scanning
   - Defaults to configuration if not specified

2. **Updated All Individual Compliance Commands:**
   - **GDPR**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **HIPAA**: Now compliance-only scanning  
   - **PCI-DSS**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **ISO-27001**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **FedRAMP**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **DPDP**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **ISO-27002**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **SOC-2**: Now compliance-only scanning
   - **NIST-CSF**: Now compliance-only scanning

3. **Enhanced Debug Logging:**
   - Clear indication when security scanning is enabled/disabled
   - Distinguishes between compliance-only and combined scans
   - Better troubleshooting capabilities

4. **Preserved Combined Functionality:**
   - Main "Scan Workspace for FedRAMP Compliance & Security" still does both
   - "Security Vulnerability Scan Only" remains unchanged
   - Configuration-based defaults preserved for combined scans

### **Benefits:**

✅ **Clean Compliance Reports:** Get pure GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS reports without security vulnerability contamination  
✅ **Better Focus:** Each compliance standard can be analyzed independently  
✅ **Maintained Flexibility:** Combined scanning still available when needed  
✅ **Enhanced Debugging:** Clear logging shows exactly what type of scan is running  
✅ **Performance Improvement:** Compliance-only scans are faster (no vulnerability scanning overhead)

### **Commands Affected:**

**Now Compliance-Only (No Security Scanning):**
- "Scan for GDPR Compliance"
- "Scan for HIPAA Compliance"  
- "Scan for PCI-DSS Compliance"
- "Scan for ISO-27001 Compliance"
- "Scan for FedRAMP Compliance" (individual)
- "Scan for DPDP Compliance"
- "Scan for ISO-27002 Compliance"
- "Scan for SOC-2 Compliance" 
- "Scan for NIST-CSF Compliance"

**Still Combined (Compliance + Security):**
- "Scan Workspace for FedRAMP Compliance & Security"
- "Security Vulnerability Scan Only" (security-only)

### **Testing Verification:**

- ✅ Extension compiles successfully
- ✅ GDPR patterns verified: 10 violations detected independently
- ✅ Debug logging enhanced throughout scanning pipeline
- ✅ Test file `test-gdpr-scan.md` ready with 10 known violations
- ✅ Comprehensive test documentation provided

### **Debug Output Examples:**

**GDPR Compliance-Only Scan:**
```
🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled: false
🔐 DEBUG: Final security scan setting: false
Starting compliance scan for standards: GDPR (compliance only)...
⏭️ DEBUG: Skipping security scan for file.ext (disabled for compliance-only scan)
```

**Combined Scan:**
```
🔒 DEBUG: Security scan enabled: true
🔐 DEBUG: Final security scan setting: true
Starting compliance scan for standards: FedRAMP with security vulnerability detection...
🔐 DEBUG: Running security scan for file.ext
```
