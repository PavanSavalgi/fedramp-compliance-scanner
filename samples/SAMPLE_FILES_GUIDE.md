- Privilege escalation risks

## üéØ How to Use These Files

### Testing Individual Standards
1. **Open a specific violation file** (e.g., `gdpr-violations.yaml`)
2. **Run the appropriate scan command**:
   - `Compliance Scanner: Scan Current File`
   - `Compliance Scanner: Generate GDPR Compliance Report`

### Testing Multi-Standard Scanning
1. **Open the multi-standard file** (`multi-standard-violations.yaml`)
2. **Run comprehensive scans**:
   - `Compliance Scanner: Scan Workspace`
   - `Compliance Scanner: Generate Individual Compliance Reports`

### Testing Workspace-Wide Scanning
1. **Open the entire workspace**
2. **Run workspace scanning**:
   - `Compliance Scanner: Scan Workspace`
   - Generate reports for specific standards you're interested in

## üîç What the Scanner Will Detect

### Compliance Violations
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, access controls, data classification
- **Privacy Rights**: Consent management, data subject rights, retention policies
- **Access Management**: Authentication, authorization, least privilege
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Audit trails, incident response, continuous monitoring
- **Data Governance**: Retention, localization, cross-border transfers

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: API keys, passwords, secrets in code
- **Weak Encryption**: Deprecated algorithms, unencrypted data
- **Access Control Issues**: Overly permissive policies, public access
- **Network Security**: Open ports, insecure protocols, network policies
- **Configuration Weaknesses**: Default settings, missing security controls

## üìä Expected Results

When scanning these files, you should see:
- **High number of violations** across multiple standards
- **Severity classifications** (Error, Warning, Info)
- **Specific compliance control references** (e.g., AC-3, SC-28, etc.)
- **Remediation suggestions** for each violation
- **Cross-standard mapping** showing how issues affect multiple frameworks

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Examples

Each violation in these files represents a **real-world misconfiguration**. The scanner will provide:
1. **Clear descriptions** of what's wrong
2. **Compliance control references** 
3. **Specific remediation steps**
4. **Best practice recommendations**

## üìù Adding Your Own Samples

To create additional test cases:
1. **Copy an existing file** as a template
2. **Add specific misconfigurations** for your use case
3. **Include comments** explaining the violations
4. **Test with the scanner** to ensure detection works

These sample files provide comprehensive coverage of compliance violations across all supported standards, making them ideal for testing, training, and demonstrating the Compliance Scanner's capabilities.
