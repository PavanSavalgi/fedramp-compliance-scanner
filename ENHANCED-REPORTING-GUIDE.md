## Scoring System Details

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall Score = (Compliance Score √ó 0.6) + (Security Score √ó 0.4)
```

### Compliance Score
- Based on control coverage: `(Controls Covered / Total Controls) √ó 100`
- Current Status: **98.8%** (159/161 controls)

### Security Score  
- Penalty-based system: `100 - ((Critical √ó 10) + (Warnings √ó 5) + (Info √ó 1))`
- Normalized per scanned file for fair assessment

### Risk Level Assignment
- **Low Risk**: Score ‚â• 90%
- **Medium Risk**: Score 70-89%
- **High Risk**: Score 50-69%
- **Critical Risk**: Score < 50%

### Grade Assignment
- **A Grade**: Score ‚â• 90%
- **B Grade**: Score 80-89%
- **C Grade**: Score 70-79%
- **D Grade**: Score 60-69%
- **F Grade**: Score < 60%
